# Welcome to Felipe's Personal Webpage Repository

Hi, my name is Felipe. People would describe me as a down to Earth, "man of the people".
I enjoy having real connections with high-purposed people, and learning their stories and motivations.

My passions circle around hardware development and understanding, computer architecture and its novel approaches,
neuromorphic computing, biological intelligence, and anything that involves deep logical-mathematical thinking.

Learning Physics has helped me understand concepts from a 1st principle approach, allowing me to learn new concepts
with ease and curiosity.
