# Welcome to Felipe's Personal Webpage Repository

  Hi, my name is Felipe. My close ones have described me as down to Earth, out of the box thinker, and a "man of the people".
I enjoy having real connections with high-purposed people, and learning their stories and motivations.

My passions circle around hardware development and understanding, computer architecture and its novel approaches,
neuromorphic computing, biological intelligence, and anything that involves deep logical-mathematical thinking plus creativity.

Learning Physics and Electronics has developed my 1st principle thinking, allowing me to learn new concepts
with ease and curiosity.
